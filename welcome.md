# Welcome to the Hall of Taps

[Home](index.md) |


**Welcome**, to what I believe is the third iteration
of the Hall of Taps. You can view all the beers and their
hall rating right [here](beers.md).

Hopefully, this time I stay committed to blogging regularly
and updating weekly the Hall and Ratings.

I also have all the Breweries with Rated Beers [here](breweries.md).
The goal is to keep this updated regularly. I used to write at baseball
(horribly), and I frequent a site called (FanGraphs)[https://www.fangraphs.com/]. FanGraphs led me to a site
called (Beergraphs)["https://beergraphs.com/"]. Which is no more, so I thought
I'd keep something in the spirit of it going.


The [the Hall of Stats](http://www.hallofstats.com) also provided inspiration for this site. In the past
this site has been powered using PHP & MySQL, as well as using C# and MSSQL. This time around
I'm using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). You can get all the data
[here]("https://github.com/AdamMcIntosh/The-Hall-of-Taps/tree/master/_data"). As time goes on I
plan on making the data better searchable, so bear with me for now.
It's a work in progress, but the journey is going to be fun (I hope).
