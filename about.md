## About the Hall of Taps
The Hall of Taps was born out of the idea that objectively some beers are better than others. While the
[Julius](https://untappd.com/b/tree-house-brewing-company-julius/237985) has more than 26 thousand ratings on Untappd, there are other >equally as good beers with less ratings. Untappd has their own top rated leaderboard, but we feel their rating is  incomplete as there has to be a mininum of 150 ratings on a beer. Also, just because a beer has many ratings doesn't
objectively make it the best craft brew. After all people drift towards craft brews to get away from the macro brewed beers.  So in a way the craft beers with many ratings are macro brews.

Ever since discovering the use of Untappd's API Adam has been obsessed with craft beer numbers. Adam came up with the idea
for the Hall of Taps, inspired by [the Hall of Stats](http://www.hallofstats.com). He designed the site, and built the site from the ground up. You can follow him on twitter [adammac__](https://twitter.com/adammac__) or his website [here](http://adam-mcintosh.com/)
