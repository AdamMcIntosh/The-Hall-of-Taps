## About the Hall of Taps
> The Hall of Taps was born out of the idea that objectively some beers are better than others. While the 
[Julius](https://untappd.com/b/tree-house-brewing-company-julius/237985) has more than 26 thousand ratings on Untappd, there are other >equally as good beers with less ratings. Untappd has their own top rated leaderboard, but we feel their rating is  incomplete as there has to be a mininum of 150 ratings on a beer. Also, just because a beer has many ratings doesn't
objectively make it the best craft brew. After all people drift towards craft brews to get away from the macro brewed beers.  >So in a way the craft beers with many ratings are macro brews.
